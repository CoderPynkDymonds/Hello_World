# Hello_World
My very first repository

Hello Everyone!

I am new to the programming and coding community.
I am currently attending college to obtain a 
Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology
with a concentration in Software Application 
Security. I am also a licensed beauty professional
and currently starting an online boutique.
I have in the recent the recent past owned two 
nail salons. I sold them before I moved to Japan.
I hope to gain lots of knowledge and experience 
so that I can one day be an efficient programmer.
Stay positive everyone and remember to LIVE
LOVE SPARKLE!!!
